- Overview:
  
This repository contains my homework assignments and projects related to the Database Management Systems course. It includes solutions for various database-related tasks, such as SQL queries, database design, NoSQL databases, and implementation of different concepts related to data management systems.

The repository showcases my work with both relational and non-relational databases, including MySQL for SQL-based tasks and MongoDB for NoSQL tasks. Each folder contains detailed instructions and solutions for individual homework assignments.

- Features:
1. SQL Queries: Solutions for SQL queries and optimization techniques using MySQL.
2. Database Design: ER diagrams, table creation scripts, and normalization techniques.
3. NoSQL with MongoDB: Working with MongoDB for handling document-based databases, including CRUD operations and data modeling.
4. Implementation: Hands-on exercises to practice database management and relational data handling, as well as NoSQL principles and their practical applications.
- Technologies Used:
1. MySQL for relational database management and querying.
2. MongoDB for NoSQL document-based database management.
3. ER Diagrams for data modeling and structure design.
4. SQL for relational database queries.
5. MongoDB Queries for NoSQL data manipulation.
- Purpose:
This repository serves as a practical application of the theory learned in the Database Management Systems course. It provides a deeper understanding of how both relational and non-relational databases work, as well as how to manage, query, and optimize data in different database environments.

Feel free to explore the work, review the assignments, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
